# Expense Tracker

A simple expense tracker web app that allows users to add, view, and delete expenses, with the total amount dynamically updated. All data is saved in `localStorage`, so the expenses persist even when the page is reloaded.

## Features

- Add expense with a name and amount
- View the list of expenses
- Delete individual expenses
- Total amount dynamically updated

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- LocalStorage (for saving data)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aayushsapkota01/ProJS-Projects/tree/main
   cd expense-tracker
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to run the application.

## How it Works

- **Add Expense**: Enter the expense name and amount, then click "Add Expense" to save it.
- **Delete Expense**: Click the "Delete" button next to any expense to remove it.
- **Total Amount**: The total amount of all expenses is automatically calculated and displayed at the bottom of the page.

### LocalStorage

All expenses are saved to the browserâ€™s `localStorage`. This means your expenses will persist even after the page is reloaded.
